# aoc-2017

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) programming puzzles.

## Setup

`yarn`

## Running tests

`yarn test:watch <day>`. For example, `yarn test:watch day1`

## Executing against the real input

After placing a file corresponding to the day in the `input` directory, `babel-node src/main.js <day> <part>`

For example, to run the second part of the day one problem, `babel-node src/main.js 1 2`
